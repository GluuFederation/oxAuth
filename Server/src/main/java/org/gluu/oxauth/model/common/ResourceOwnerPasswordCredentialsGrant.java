/**
 * <p>
 * The resource owner password credentials (i.e. username and password) can be
 * used directly as an authorization grant to obtain an access token. The
 * credentials should only be used when there is a high degree of trust between
 * the resource owner and the client (e.g. its device operating system or a
 * highly privileged application), and when other authorization grant types are
 * not available (such as an authorization code).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Even though this grant type requires direct client access to the resource
 * owner credentials, the resource owner credentials are used for a single
 * request and are exchanged for an access token. This grant type can eliminate
 * the need for the client to store the resource owner credentials for future
 * use, by exchanging the credentials with a long-lived access token or refresh
 * token.

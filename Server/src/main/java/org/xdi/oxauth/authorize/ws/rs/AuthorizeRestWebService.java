     *                            <strong>code</strong>, <strong>token</strong>, <strong>id_token</strong>
     *                            a combination of them. The response type parameter is mandatory.

     * @param redirectUri         Redirection URI
     * @param state               An opaque value used by the client to maintain state between
     *                            the request and callback. The authorization server includes
     *                            this value when redirecting the user-agent back to the client.
     *                            The parameter should be used for preventing cross-site request
     *                            forgery.
     * @param responseMode        Informs the Authorization Server of the mechanism to be used for returning parameters
     *                            from the Authorization Endpoint. This use of this parameter is NOT RECOMMENDED when the
     *                            Response Mode that would be requested is the default mode specified for the Response Type.
     * @param nonce               A string value used to associate a user agent session with an ID Token,
     *                            and to mitigate replay attacks.
     * @param display             An ASCII string value that specifies how the Authorization Server displays the
     *                            authentication page to the End-User.

     *                            space-separated list of BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag values, ordered by preference.
     * @param idTokenHint         Previously issued ID Token passed to the Authorization Server as a hint about the
     *                            End-User's current or past authenticated session with the Client.
     * @param loginHint           Hint to the Authorization Server about the login identifier the End-User might use to
     *                            log in (if necessary).
     * @param acrValues           Requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Space-separated string that
     *                            specifies the acr values that the Authorization Server is being requested to use for
     *                            processing this Authentication Request, with the values appearing in order of preference.
     * @param amrValues           Requested Authentication Methods References. JSON array of strings that are identifiers
     *                            for authentication methods used in the authentication. For instance, values might indicate
     *                            that both password and OTP authentication methods were used. The definition of particular

     *                            is an array of case sensitive strings.
     * @param request             A JWT  encoded OpenID Request Object.
     * @param requestUri          An URL that points to an OpenID Request Object.
     * @param codeChallenge       PKCE code challenge

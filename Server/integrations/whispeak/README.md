# Whispeak
## Overview
[Whispeak](https://whispeak.io) Whispeak is a speaker recognition software as a service platform that makes it easy to add a biometric factor to authentication processes. Donâ€™t choose between security and fluidity.

This script allows to enroll and authenticate using voice biometrics as single factor or second factor.
It integrates with Passport Gluu installation in order to secure the enrollment and to provide a fallback for authentication if not possible to use voice.

This integration is optional if enrollment securization is not needed nor fallback.

## Configure oxTrust 

Follow the steps below to configure the Whispeak module in the oxTrust Admin GUI.

1. Navigate to `Configuration` > `Person Authentication Scripts`.
1. Scroll down to the Whispeak authentication script   

1. Configure the properties, all of which are mandatory, according to your API    

1. Enable the script by ticking the check box    
![enable](../img/admin-guide/enable.png)

Now Whispeak's biometric authentication is available as an authentication mechanism for your Gluu Server. This means that, using OpenID Connect `acr_values`, applications can now request Whispeak biometric authentication for users. 

!!! Note 
    To make sure Whispeak has been enabled successfully, you can check your Gluu Server's OpenID Connect configuration by navigating to the following URL: `https://<hostname>/.well-known/openid-configuration`. Find `"acr_values_supported":` and you should see `"whispeak"`.
